# Dinky-Little-Netplay-Bot
A simple Discord bot to manage netplay information such as links, IP Addresses, etc.  Useful for managing netplay links and user IPs on Discord servers.

Some features include:
- Console sorting system, allowing users to add games on a per-console basis.
- Associate website links to games
- List all your games at once with a simple command; games are listed by system
- Add user IP Addresses, useful for managing netplay between users
- Permissions system, allowing only certain users access to certain commands

In order to run the bot, simply clone this repository, edit "config.ini", then run:

```
./main.py
```

This bot requires Python 3.5+.  You will also need the discord.py library (https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py)

Development for this bot is ongoing.  If you have any issues or want to see a certain feature in the bot, open an issue in the Issues tab, or shoot me a PM over Discord.
